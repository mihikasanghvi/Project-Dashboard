# Project-Dashboard
This project is a platform to give opportunities to students of a university to explore the various domains of research and projects that they can undertake. Helping faculty easily find
interested students to collaborate and help with their ongoing projects with listings of all such research and opportunities on one single platform. We are facilitating interaction and guidance between students and faculty of the university and helping them easily look for research opportunities.

# Objectives
• The project originates due to the need to collaborate on projects and research opportunities by professors with university students. To make communication easier and to provide a common platform for all such projects and research opportunities this platform helps immensely.

• The students can register and explore various branches under which professors wish to collaborate. This not only helps students looking for experience in their own field of study but also someone who is interested in a completely different field.

• The professors can publish their requirements on the website and describe the project or research they are undertaking. Students can then apply by linking their resumes and professors putting up the results on the announcement page.
